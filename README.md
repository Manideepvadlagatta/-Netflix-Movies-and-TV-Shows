Data cleaning and data preprocessing of  Netflix Movies and TV Shows
## ðŸ“– Overview
This project demonstrates **cleaning and preprocessing** the Netflix Titles dataset using Python and pandas. The dataset contains information about Netflix movies and TV shows, including **titles, directors, cast, country, date added, rating, duration, and type**.

The aim is to make the dataset **consistent, clean, and ready for analysis**, so it can be used for **exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, or machine learning projects**.

## ðŸ”§ Features / Cleaning Steps

1. **Handling Missing Values**  
   - `director` and `cast` â†’ filled with `"Unknown"`  
   - `country` â†’ filled with `"Not Specified"`  
   - `rating` â†’ filled with `"Not Rated"`  
   - `duration` â†’ filled with `"Not Specified"`  

2. **Date Formatting**  
   - Converted `date_added` from `"Month Day, Year"` â†’ `"MM-DD-YYYY"`  
   - Backfilled missing dates to ensure consistency  

3. **Data Standardization**  
   - Standardized `type` and `country` columns with **title case** and removed extra spaces  

4. **Removing Duplicates**  
   - Dropped duplicate rows to ensure uniqueness
